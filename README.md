The project name is Happy Trails. This was my final project for Flatiron School.
Happy Trails allows you to search trails near an address you type in, let you save trails for you to view later, and/or write a review of trails.

Here is the [demo](https://happytrails.surge.sh/) 

This is the backend Rails API of the project.
